# PyInstaller
# - For obvious reasons, PyInstaller includes the source code in its build output.
#   If you want to distribute a PyInstaller build, you should be sure to verify
#   that your source files have the appropriate license and distribution terms.
#
#   Generally, you will want to build your PyInstaller executable from a checkout
#   of your git repository.
